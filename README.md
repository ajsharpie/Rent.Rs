# rently

This project is my first personal project during the Boot.dev courses. 

It's a little ambitious, but I am determined - I think it will take longer than the 20-40 hours as I'm working with a few new tools: Dart, flutter, and firebase.

The implementation will be fairly simple, but the whole of the project will be a much larger scale than the bootdev folks likely intended. 


# Updated on submission:

It was definitely challenging. AI helped more than I'd like to admit. But I got it working well enough for now. Able to add properties, view records for those properties, and add rent records (this took forever to figure out because of typing and storing a list of a custom class within a custom class). Didn't implement any delete options yet, but have the firebase methods to do so. 

## Updates to be made:

I would still like to implement these features:

 - Ability to refactor and delete properties
 - Ability to edit rent amounts on creation of rent records
    - Ability to delete rent records
 - Authenticate users
 - Themeing options within GUI (colors)
 - Store photographs of properties and make the propety selection page use a gridview of cards with a main photo of each property
 - Store tenant data for each property
 - *export records to csv* option for each property/all properties with customizable record dates
