This project is my first personal project during the Boot.dev courses. 

Its a little ambitious, but I am determined - I think it will take longer than the 20-40 hours as I'm working with a few new tools: Dart, flutter, and firebase.

The implementation will be fairly simple, but the whole of the project will be a much larger scale than the bootdev folks likely intended.
